Official code implementation of "MRFP: Learning Generalizable Semantic Segmentation from Sim-2-Real with Multi-Resolution Feature Perturbation"

In this work, we propose to tackle the issue of detecting and segmenting small and complex-shaped buildings in Electro-Optical (EO) and SAR satellite imagery. A novel architecture Deep Multi-scale Aware Overcomplete Network (DeepMAO), is proposed that comprises an overcomplete branch that focuses on fine structural features and an undercomplete (U-Net) branch tasked to focus on coarse, semantic-rich features. Additionally, a novel self-regulating augmentation strategy, “Loss-Mix,” is proposed to increase pixel representation of misclassified pixels.
